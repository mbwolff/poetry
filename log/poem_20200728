du moins , c' est ce qu' on leur demande
enfin bon , ça , ce n' est pas dans mon estime
en tout cas , la tentation est grande
mais non , non , c' est pas possible , c' est un régime

en tout cas , c' est exactement l' inverse
en même temps , c' est le principe même de la bad
hé oui , ce n' est pas un fonds de commerce
et c' est là que la situation se dégrade



2020-07-28 11:26:23 NO nmfdim

je ne sais pas si tout va bien
et là , ce n' est pas si mal , mais je m' en moque
en tout cas merci pour ton soutien
par contre , il ne s' agit que d' un bloc

en tout cas , c' est le seul point négatif
mais non , il ne s' agit pas de racisme
je dirais même qu' il s' agit de juifs
en fait , il s' agit du christianisme

thank you , thank you for your web site
i look forward to hearing from you soon
i am so glad i found your website
i 'm glad to see you at school this afternoon

in fact , this is the perfect place to live
it is the perfect place to sleep , sleep and sleep
however , it is still too expensive
one thing , however , is that it is cheap



2020-07-28 11:37:11 nmfdim 1 (sauce, grilled, fried)

for starters , we often try to make an arrest
sometimes , i prefer a fresh perspective
of course , my chicken dish is probably the best
well , sometimes it 's a bit too expensive

well , add a bit of vanilla ice cream
i prefer a sweet slice of pie crust
i love cooking , it 's a sweet dream
i love cooking pasta bread , but it 's a must



2020-07-28 11:41:10 nmfdim 2 (narrowed, shrugged, swig)

oh , yeah , ive never looked at college
dane nodded , but i felt a little nervous
i narrowed my eyes , trying to manage
i took a deep breath and tried to focus

i shook my head , forcing myself to relax
i shook my head and turned to face the man
i shut the door and put my arms behind their backs
as i walked toward the door , i turned and ran



2020-07-28 11:44:22 nmfdim 5 (unto, hath, thou)

o god the holy spirit shall bring rock and roll
o the lord jesus christ whom the lord shall give
o unto thee , o lord , o thou , o soul

so , i learned , and i am so glad i did
in fact , i believe it is worth the effort
however , it is much better than expected
as a matter of fact , it is the expert

in fact , that is how it happened , he added
so now you are working on the topic
so , what do you think is the way forward
what do you think about art or music



2020-07-28 11:55:14 NO nmfdim

if not , this was the best moment to get there
i mean , how do you know what to expect
he asked as he ran his hand through his hair
he shook his head , trying to change the subject

i didnt want to ask if i was thinking at all
i mean , i dont know what they were
i mean , could you give me a call
what are you going to do for you , sir



2020-07-28 11:58:32 nmfdim 1 (sauce, grilled, fried)

i ca n't wait to try this tasty dish
i 'll try to make a hearty dessert then
sometimes i 'll try to eat fried fish
well , whole roast chicken tastes too good to men

this is the perfect soup recipe i 've had
melt butter and sugar in a small mixing bowl
add flour , baking powder , salt and pepper and add
in a mixing bowl , add chopped onion roll



2020-07-28 12:29:29 nmfdim 2 (narrowed, shrugged, swig)

maybe he thought she 'd be looking for food
taking a deep breath , she lowered her gaze
oh , oh , um , uh , um , uh , oh , i 'm in a weird mood
i shook my head and shook my head anyways

i am so sorry , she whispered , letting go
i nodded , knowing that i knew what to expect
i took a quick glance toward the window
i closed my eyes and saw nothing to protect



2020-07-28 12:54:45 nmfdim 2 (narrowed, shrugged, swig)

i 'm looking forward to the rest of the conference
i 'm thinking of taking a closer look and feel
i 'm so glad i 've asked for assistance
i nodded and moved my hand across the front wheel

i closed my eyes and grabbed the phone
i smiled and crossed my arms across his chest
i shook my head with a wry smile of my own
i gave him a curt nod and headed west



2020-07-28 13:01:36 nmfdim 13 (sorrow, longing, admiration)

may god bless my soul and my dear friend
thank you so much for your kindness as well
i hope you had a great long weekend
yet , so far , there is far too much to tell

it 's no wonder i spoke to my own heart
i did n't mind seeing things in all directions
besides , i never thought i 'd fall apart
oh , man , i would have my own reasons



2020-07-28 13:17:47 nmfdim 11 (texted, okay, im)

i guess thats the way in which we live
alice shook her head and looked at my feet
what do you think youre gon na give
sighing , he turned and walked off down the street

he 'd tried to call a cab , but he knew he 'd stayed
he was n't sure why she 'd asked him , in fact
yes , i guess you dont wan na trade
oh , but i cant say ive met the contract



2020-07-28 13:20:58 nmfdim 3 (scored, league, season)

2020-07-28 13:21:49 nmfdim 4 (sobbed, sobs, sob)

we 'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback
we ca n't wait to hear the rest of this act
do you think she 'll still have a heart attack
okay , i 'm trying too hard to grasp that fact

but then again , i 'm keeping an open mind
shaking his head , he put his hands in his suit
for a moment , he felt something warm and kind
he wanted to hold his hand , ready to shoot



2020-07-28 13:26:21 nmfdim 2 (narrowed, shrugged, swig)

the man jumped from the table and shook his head , still

a. no , you do n't have what it takes
a. i do n't have to be directed at
a. you have to press on the brakes



2020-07-28 21:19:40 nmfdim 1 (sauce, grilled, fried)

i do n't always drink salt , but i 'll try again
i do n't think i 'll ever eat fresh fruit
anyway , i think i 'll cook a little rain
if you 're eating dessert , i 'm sure i 'll shoot

if i do n't eat fried chicken , i 'll try that
i do n't eat roast beef , of course not
i do n't eat the grill too cold , but i do n't eat fat
i do n't eat junk food , but i do n't eat a lot

oh , the front door was closed last august
i 'm sorry i got too close a few months ago
melissa asked , shaking her head in disgust
im sorry , she whispered , her eyes narrow

she bit her lip and took another swig of food
lexi shook her head and she leaned forward
um , um , uh , uh , um , um , i think i 'm in a bad mood
yeah , i 'm sorry i 'd felt a little awkward



2020-07-28 21:28:23 nmfdim 3 (scored, league, season)

the first team won the first four wins first prize
the second was the first to win the first victory

the third was the first to win the final three

the first three went on strike in the fifth season
in the fourth , the third team scored twice
in the third match , the first two teams scored seven
the first two rounds played the first four mice



2020-07-28 21:33:26 nmfdim 4 (sobbed, sobs, sob)

instead , we 'll move in just a few minutes
if i 'm taking a hot shower , though , i 'm fine
or maybe i 'm trying to push my limits
i close my eyes , but i still feel mine

i 'm trying to stop myself , but i ca n't speak
i take a deep breath and let my tears fall
i shake my head as she kisses my cheek
for a moment , i do n't think i 'm sorry at all



2020-07-28 21:39:08 nmfdim 5 (unto, hath, thou)

praise the lord jesus christ , no matter what
o god , you have done a great show
i pray that i trust thee to enter the thought
i prayed unto the lord thy god shall know

o ye , o lord , come unto thee , amen
o sing unto thee , o lord hath a wicked smile
o thou , o bless thee , o lord bless thee then
o , o thou , o thou bring forth thy exile



2020-07-28 21:44:10 nmfdim 6 (slashing, slashed, rage)

he is the head of the blood fighting team
he has the guts to fight and kill everyone
i shouted , fighting the urge to scream
i took a deep breath and then lifted the gun

when it hit the ground , my face turned pale
i could feel a surge of anger , though
i fought with the pain , but to no avail
i screamed in rage , but i couldnt let go

they took a deep breath , giving their best
zane 's mouth began to swell , but it did n't stop
he gripped her hips and her hands touched his chest
when he licked her lips , he felt her jaw drop

with a gentle caress , he kept his balance
he wanted to touch his lips and feel the wet mix
when he squeezed her hand , she 'd felt his presence
it was a soft kiss that was getting closer to six



2020-07-28 21:59:10 nmfdim 9 (dismounted, exchanged, stiffly)

the man shuddered , shaking his head or not
he paused for a long moment , still upset
gideon shook his head and took one last shot
it looked as though he 'd gone off the set

then he closed his eyes and began to read
when he straightened , his face went white
jason nodded again , that 's all i need
gideon opened the door and stood up , right



2020-07-28 22:09:53 nmfdim 8 (clit, erection, cock)

his hands moved closer and he felt the gentle man
he licked his lips , his eyes wide open
her hands tightened on his chest and thighs felt swollen
when he took a deep breath , he slowly ran

his jaw was clenched tight but still serious
cupping his face in his hand , he held his own wits
he cupped her cheek until her body knew its
it was a hard kiss , it 'd seemed so damn obvious

a low moan echoed in the distance
he lifted his head , his tongue moving
her fingers gripped his neck , pulling him off balance

she moaned , but she could n't stop breathing
his lips caressed hers and she felt his presence
arching her hips , she felt a sinking feeling

i 've seen these birds eat all kinds of things
have you ever seen a wild elephant man
have you seen a wild cat in a small village
have you seen a stray dog herd a small hill

why have these wild dogs seen such a short span
have you ever seen a wild animal known

2020-07-28 22:38:37 nmfdim 55 (predators, breed, animals)

just like these two little cats are known to shoot
i have never seen a cat dog so cute

i have only seen animals in my childhood
i have never seen these dogs smell so good

the brightness of the sun can be seen in the shop
when the sun reaches the moon , the sun will stop

when i reach the sky the sun takes my hand
the moon shines light on the moon from earth and

have you ever seen a giant cosmic pot
is it a giant space telescope , or not

no wonder i discovered the magic part
mars must have seen the whole story from the start



2020-07-28 22:54:20 nmfdim 26 (dudes, dude, ol)

yeah , im sure thats the name of the act
hmm , i guess you guys dont make eye contact

i think a bunch of guys got a bit too casual
i hate to think i 'm a real jewel

oh , and i honestly think i 'm kinda dumb
i mean , i think i 'm gon na tease her thumb

um , yeah , i think maybe i 'm a bad guy
maybe i 'm ok , but i 'm not really sure why



2020-07-28 22:59:05 nmfdim 13 (sorrow, longing, admiration)

i wonder what else might come in this role
i wish i knew how much i loved my own soul

but alas , i never felt very much welcome
have you ever thought of the old system

i have n't seen it yet , i just hope not
i dont mind though , i love this poem a lot

it is always a pleasure to write
i am so glad i stumbled upon your site



2020-07-28 23:05:19 nmfdim 13 (sorrow, longing, admiration)

yet , there is far too much to prepare
oh man , i would love to go there

oh , dear , so glad i read your articles
oh , great , i am very fond of animals

i cherish every moment with my own hand
i will never forget my own happiness , and

i will always be a joy to others
i 'd forgotten how much i loved seeing strangers



2020-07-28 23:10:30 nmfdim 13 (sorrow, longing, admiration)

i wonder though , we ca n't find it here
alas , i think it 's by far the very best
oh , my dear , my dear , dear readers
i am very , very solemn , yet i am not

for a moment i felt a gentle hand on my chest
the rest seemed too long , but i did n't want to stop
it was a dreadful sight , not by a long shot
may his soul rest in eternal peace

i hope i thought i 'd let my heart drop
i am , sadly , a lonely , sad , sad little man
i 'll never forget this thing with the police
the young man stood gazing at her in disgust

do you ever regret anything , he began
perhaps that might be a terrible idea
the old man smiled , his face filled with dust
tears of joy filled his eyes and met hers
