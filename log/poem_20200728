du moins , c' est ce qu' on leur demande
enfin bon , ça , ce n' est pas dans mon estime
en tout cas , la tentation est grande
mais non , non , c' est pas possible , c' est un régime

en tout cas , c' est exactement l' inverse
en même temps , c' est le principe même de la bad
hé oui , ce n' est pas un fonds de commerce
et c' est là que la situation se dégrade

je ne sais pas si tout va bien
et là , ce n' est pas si mal , mais je m' en moque
en tout cas merci pour ton soutien
par contre , il ne s' agit que d' un bloc

en tout cas , c' est le seul point négatif
mais non , il ne s' agit pas de racisme
je dirais même qu' il s' agit de juifs
en fait , il s' agit du christianisme

thank you , thank you for your web site
i look forward to hearing from you soon
i am so glad i found your website
i 'm glad to see you at school this afternoon

in fact , this is the perfect place to live
it is the perfect place to sleep , sleep and sleep
however , it is still too expensive
one thing , however , is that it is cheap

for starters , we often try to make an arrest
sometimes , i prefer a fresh perspective
of course , my chicken dish is probably the best
well , sometimes it 's a bit too expensive

well , add a bit of vanilla ice cream
i prefer a sweet slice of pie crust
i love cooking , it 's a sweet dream
i love cooking pasta bread , but it 's a must

oh , yeah , ive never looked at college
dane nodded , but i felt a little nervous
i narrowed my eyes , trying to manage
i took a deep breath and tried to focus

i shook my head , forcing myself to relax
i shook my head and turned to face the man
i shut the door and put my arms behind their backs
as i walked toward the door , i turned and ran

o o o o o o o o o o hath missed

o lord hath poured forth upon the forest

so , i learned , and i am so glad i did
in fact , i believe it is worth the effort
however , it is much better than expected
as a matter of fact , it is the expert

in fact , that is how it happened , he added
so now you are working on the topic
so , what do you think is the way forward
what do you think about art or music

if not , this was the best moment to get there
i mean , how do you know what to expect
he asked as he ran his hand through his hair
he shook his head , trying to change the subject

i didnt want to ask if i was thinking at all
i mean , i dont know what they were
i mean , could you give me a call
what are you going to do for you , sir

i ca n't wait to try this tasty dish
i 'll try to make a hearty dessert then
sometimes i 'll try to eat fried fish
well , whole roast chicken tastes too good to men

this is the perfect soup recipe i 've had
melt butter and sugar in a small mixing bowl
add flour , baking powder , salt and pepper and add
in a mixing bowl , add chopped onion roll

maybe he thought she 'd be looking for food
taking a deep breath , she lowered her gaze
oh , oh , um , uh , um , uh , oh , i 'm in a weird mood
i shook my head and shook my head anyways

i am so sorry , she whispered , letting go
i nodded , knowing that i knew what to expect
i took a quick glance toward the window
i closed my eyes and saw nothing to protect



2020-07-28 12:54:45 nmfdim 2 (narrowed, shrugged, swig)

i 'm looking forward to the rest of the conference
i 'm thinking of taking a closer look and feel
i 'm so glad i 've asked for assistance
i nodded and moved my hand across the front wheel

i closed my eyes and grabbed the phone
i smiled and crossed my arms across his chest
i shook my head with a wry smile of my own
i gave him a curt nod and headed west
